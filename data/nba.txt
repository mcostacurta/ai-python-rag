The National Basketball Association (NBA) is governed by a comprehensive set of rules that dictate the structure, gameplay, and operations of the league. These rules cover various aspects, from the dimensions of the court and player duties to scoring regulations, timing, and team composition.

Court Dimensions and Equipment
The NBA court is a rectangular surface measuring 94 feet in length and 50 feet in width. The court is divided into two halves by the midcourt line, with each team's basket situated at the opposite ends. The baskets are 10 feet high, and the three-point line extends 23 feet, 9 inches from the center of the basket. The game is played with a standard leather basketball that measures between 29.5 and 30 inches in circumference and weighs between 20 and 22 ounces.

Duties of Officials
The NBA employs a team of officials, including referees and umpires, to oversee the game and enforce the rules. Referees are responsible for making calls, administering penalties, and managing the game clock and score. They also have the authority to eject players or coaches for unsportsmanlike conduct. Umpires assist the referees in monitoring player and team behavior, ensuring the game is played fairly and within the rules.

Player Roles and Substitutions
Each NBA team consists of five players on the court at a time. When a player accumulates six personal fouls, they are disqualified from the game. If a team is left with fewer than five eligible players due to injuries or ejections, the last player who was disqualified for personal fouls must re-enter the game. Subsequent replacements follow this reverse order. Any re-entry of a disqualified player results in a technical foul.
Substitutions must be reported to the scorer and positioned near the substitution box before entering the game. Substitutes are not allowed to enter the game during a free throw or a player jump, except in cases of injury or ejection.

Scoring and Timing Regulations
Scoring in basketball is determined by the location of the successful field goal attempt. Shots made from within the three-point line are worth two points, while shots made from beyond the three-point line are worth three points. If a player mistakenly scores in the opponent's basket, the points are added to the opponent's score and attributed to the player nearest to the action.
Regulation play in the NBA consists of four 12-minute quarters, with a 15-minute break between halves. Overtime periods are five minutes long. The game clock operates with precision, displaying tenths-of-a-second during the final minute of each period. Each team is allotted a specific number of charged timeouts during the game, with restrictions on the number that can be used in the fourth quarter.

End of Period and Overtime
If the score is tied at the end of regulation play, the game proceeds to overtime periods without changing baskets. The timing devices are managed meticulously, with stoppages at defined moments during the game. The rules around timeouts are detailed, specifying the number of timeouts allowed, their duration, and the circumstances under which they can be requested and granted. Regulations concerning time-ins after timeouts, including the restart of the game clock, are outlined to ensure fair and organized gameplay.

Recent Rule Changes
The NBA has introduced several rule changes for the 2023-24 season, including the implementation of the NBA Cup, a new in-season tournament, and a crackdown on in-game flopping. The NBA Cup will divide teams into six groups based on their previous season's records, with the top-ranked team from each group and two wild card teams advancing to the knockout stage.
The league has also implemented a "Jaylen Brown Rule," which allows teams to offer 140% of a player's previous salary as the starting salary of a new extension. Additionally, the NBA has introduced new policies to discourage load management, requiring players to participate in at least 65 games to be eligible for certain regular-season awards, and allowing the league to fine teams for resting stars during nationally televised games.

Team Composition and Franchises
The NBA is composed of 30 teams, 29 in the United States and 1 in Canada. The teams are divided into two 15-team conferences, with each conference further divided into three divisions of five teams each. The current divisional alignment was introduced in the 2004-05 season.
The NBA originated in 1946 as the Basketball Association of America (BAA) and later merged with the National Basketball League (NBL) in 1949. Over the years, the league has undergone various expansions, reductions, and relocations, with teams joining from the American Basketball Association (ABA) in 1976.
The Boston Celtics are the most successful franchise in NBA history, with 18 championships. The league's current reigning champions are the Boston Celtics, who defeated the Dallas Mavericks in the 2024 NBA Finals.
In summary, the NBA is governed by a comprehensive set of rules that cover court dimensions, player roles, scoring, timing, and team composition. The league has undergone numerous changes and expansions since its inception, with the Boston Celtics being the most successful franchise. The recent rule changes, such as the NBA Cup and the "Jaylen Brown Rule," aim to enhance the league's competitiveness and address issues like load management.
